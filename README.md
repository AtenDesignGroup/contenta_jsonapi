# TODO

## Usage

* [Get composer](getcomposer.org)
* Create a new project using a command like this. This will pull down the installation profile + core + modules, so maybe get a cup of tea:
```
composer create-project drupal-http-apis/contenta-jsonapi-project MYPROJECT --stability dev --no-interaction
```

## Development

Discussions are done in <[#contenta on slack](https://drupal.slack.com/messages/C5A70F7D1/)

For documention on the development on contenta_jsonapi itself, see [docs/development](https://github.com/drupal-http-apis/contenta_jsonapi/blob/master/docs/development.md)


## Credits

This work is based upon a couple of contrib modules.

On top of that the [thunder distrbution](http://www.thunder.org/) was used as sort of a base
for this installation profile.
